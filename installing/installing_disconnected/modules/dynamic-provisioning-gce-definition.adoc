kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard  <1>
  zone: us-central1-a  <2>
  zones: us-central1-a, us-central1-b, us-east1-b  <3>
  fsType: ext4 <4>
----
<1> Select either `pd-standard` or `pd-ssd`. The default is `pd-ssd`.
<2> GCE zone. If no zone is specified, volumes are generally round-robined
across all active zones where the {product-title} cluster has a node. 
Zone and zones parameters must not be used at the same time.
<3> A comma-separated list of GCE zone(s). If no zone is specified, 
volumes are generally round-robined across all active zones where the 
{product-title} cluster has a node. Zone and zones parameters must not 
be used at the same time.
<4> File system that is created on dynamically provisioned volumes. This 
value is copied to the `fsType` field of dynamically provisioned 
persistent volumes and the file system is created when the volume is 
mounted for the first time. The default value is `ext4`.
