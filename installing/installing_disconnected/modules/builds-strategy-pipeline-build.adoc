= Pipeline build

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a _Jenkins pipeline_ for
execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started, monitored,
and managed by {product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly in the
build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build
configuration.

//The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline
//strategy, {product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the
//pipeline. Subsequent Pipeline build configurations in the project share this
//Jenkins server.

//.Additional resources

//* Pipeline build configurations require a Jenkins server to manage the
//pipeline execution.
