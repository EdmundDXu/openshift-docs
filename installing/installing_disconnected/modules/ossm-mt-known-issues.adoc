= Known issues with multi-tenant {ProductName} installations

Here is a summary of the known issues with multi-tenant {ProductShortName} installations.

[WARNING]
====
Automatic route creation is currently incompatible with multi-tenant {ProductShortName} installations. Ensure that it is disabled, by setting `ior_enabled` to `false` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` if you plan to attempt a multi-tenant installation.
====

* `MeshPolicy` is still a cluster-scoped resource and applies to all control planes installed in OpenShift. This can prevent the installation of multiple control planes or cause unknown behavior if one control plane is deleted.
* The Jaeger agent runs as a `DaemonSet`, therefore `tracing` may only be enabled for a single `ServiceMeshControlPlane` instance.
* If you delete the project that contains the control plane before you delete the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, some parts of the installation may not be removed:
** Service accounts added to the `SecurityContextConstraints` may not be removed.
** `OAuthClient` resources associated with Kiali may not be removed, or its list of redirectURIs may not be accurate.
