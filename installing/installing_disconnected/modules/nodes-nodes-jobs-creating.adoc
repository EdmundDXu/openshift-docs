= Creating jobs

You create a job in {product-title} by creating a job object.

.Procedure

To create a job:

. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  parallelism: 1    <1>
  completions: 1    <2>
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 1800 <3>
  backoffLimit: 6   <4>
  template:         <5>
    metadata:
      name: pi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure    <6>
----
1. Optional value for how many pod replicas a job should run in parallel; defaults to `completions`.
2. Optional value for how many successful pod completions are needed to mark a job completed; defaults to one.
3. Optional value for the maximum duration the job can run.
4. Option value to set the number of retries for a job. This field defaults to six.
5. Template for the pod the controller creates.
6. The restart policy of the pod. This does not apply to the job controller.

. Create the job:
+
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
You can also create and launch a job from a single command using `oc run`. The following command creates and launches the same job as specified in the previous example:

----
$ oc run pi --image=perl --replicas=1  --restart=OnFailure \
    --command -- perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'
----
