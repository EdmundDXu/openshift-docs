= Updating the node configuration

Before you can install the {ProductShortName} into an {product-title} installation, you must modify the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes. These changes enable the features that are required in the {ProductShortName} and also ensure that Elasticsearch features function correctly.

[NOTE]
====
Updating the node configuration is not necessary if you are running {product-title} 4.1.
