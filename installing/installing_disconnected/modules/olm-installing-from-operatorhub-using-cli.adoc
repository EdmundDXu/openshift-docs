= Installing from the OperatorHub using the CLI

Instead of using the {product-title} web console, you can install an Operator
from the OperatorHub using the CLI. Use the `oc` command to create or update a
CatalogSourceConfig object, then add a Subscription object.

[NOTE]
====
The web console version of this procedure handles the creation of the
CatalogSourceConfig and Subscription objects behind the scenes for you,
appearing as if it was one step.
====

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin`
permissions.

- Install the *oc* command to your local system.

.Procedure

. View the list of Operators available to the cluster from the OperatorHub:
+
----
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
NAME                     AGE
amq-streams              14h
packageserver            15h
couchbase-enterprise     14h
mongodb-enterprise       14h
etcd                     14h
myoperator               14h
...
----

. To identify the Operators to enable on the cluster, create a CatalogSourceConfig
object YAML file (for example, `csc.cr.yaml`). Include one or more packages
listed in the previous step (such as couchbase-enterprise or etcd). For example:
+
.Example CatalogSourceConfig
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: CatalogSourceConfig
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  targetNamespace: openshift-operators <1>
  packages: myoperator <2>
----
<1> Set the `targetNamespace` to identify the namespace where you want the Operator
to be available. The `openshift-operators` namespace is watched by the Operator
Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
<2> Set `packages` to a comma-separated list of Operators to which you want to
subscribe.
+
The Operator generates a CatalogSource from your CatalogSourceConfig in the
namespace specified in `targetNamespace`.

. Create the CatalogSourceConfig to enable the specified Operators in the selected
namespace:
+
----
$ oc apply -f csc.cr.yaml
----

. Create a Subscription object YAML file (for example, `myoperator-sub.yaml`) to
subscribe a namespace to an Operator. Note that the namespace you pick
must have an OperatorGroup that matches the installMode (either AllNamespaces or
SingleNamespace modes):
+
.Example Subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: myoperator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: myoperator <1>
  source: example <2>
  sourceNamespace: openshift-operators
----
<1> Name of the Operator to subscribe to.
<2> Name of the CatalogSource that was created.

. Create the Subscription object:
+
----
$ oc apply -f myoperator-sub.yaml
----
+
At this point, the OLM is now aware of the selected Operator. A
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target
namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.

. Later, if you want to install more Operators:

.. Update your CatalogSourceConfig file (in this example, `csc.cr.yaml`) with
more packages. For example:
+
.Example updated CatalogSourceConfig
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: CatalogSourceConfig
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  targetNamespace: global
  packages: myoperator,another-operator <1>
----
<1> Add new packages to existing package list.

.. Update the CatalogSourceConfig object:
+
----
$ oc apply -f csc.cr.yaml
----

.. Create additional Subscription objects for the new Operators.

.Additional resources

* To install custom Operators to a cluster using the OperatorHub, you must first
upload your Operator artifacts to Quay.io, then add your own `OperatorSource` to
your cluster. Optionally, you can add Secrets to your Operator to provide
authentication. After, you can manage the Operator in your cluster as you would
any other Operator. For these steps, see link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/blob/master/docs/testing-operators.md[Testing Operators].
