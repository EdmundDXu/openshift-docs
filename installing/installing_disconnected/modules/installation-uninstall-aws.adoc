= Removing a cluster from AWS

You can remove a cluster that you installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

.Prerequisites

* Have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.

.Procedure

. Optional: From the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the
following command and record the UUID that it outputs:
+
----
$ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterID}{"\n"}' version
----
+
If not all of the cluster resources are removed from AWS, you can use this UUID
to locate them and remove them.

. From the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir=<installation_directory> --log-level=debug <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify the directory that contains the cluster definition files for
your cluster. The installation program requires the `metadata.json` file in this
directory to delete the cluster.
====

. Optional: Delete the `<installation_directory>` directory and the
{product-title} installation program.
