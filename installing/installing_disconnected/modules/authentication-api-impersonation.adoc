= API impersonation
A request to the {product-title} API can include an `Impersonate-User` header,
which indicates that the requester wants the request handled as though
it came from the specified user.

Before User A can impersonate User B, User A is authenticated.
Then, an authorization check occurs to ensure that User A is allowed to
impersonate the user named User B. If User A is requesting to impersonate a
service account, `system:serviceaccount:namespace:name`, {product-title} confirms
that User A can impersonate the `serviceaccount` named `name` in
`namespace`. If the check fails, the request fails with a 403 (Forbidden) error
code.

By default, project administrators and editors can impersonate
service accounts in their namespace.

The `sudoers` role allows a user to
impersonate `system:admin`, which in turn has cluster administrator permissions.
The ability to impersonate `system:admin` grants some protection against typos,
but not security, for someone
administering the cluster. For example, running `oc delete nodes --all` fails,
but running `oc delete nodes --all --as=system:admin` succeeds.
