= {product-title} OAuth authentication

OAuth authentication is activated by configuring options on the *Configure
Global Security* panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the
`OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH` environment variable on the Jenkins *Deployment
configuration* to anything other than `false`. This activates the {product-title}
Login plug-in, which retrieves the configuration information from Pod data or by
interacting with the {product-title} API server.

Valid credentials are controlled by the {product-title} identity provider.

Jenkins supports both browser and non-browser access.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log
in, where {product-title} `Roles` dictate the specific Jenkins permissions the
users have.

Users with the `admin` role have the traditional Jenkins administrative
user permissions. Users with the `edit` or `view` role have progressively
fewer permissions.

[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with
administrative privileges is not given those privileges when
{product-title} OAuth is used. To grant these permissions the {product-title}
cluster administrator must explicitly define that user in the {product-title}
identity provider and assigs the `admin` role to the user.
====

Jenkins users' permissions that are stored can be changed after the users are
initially established. The OpenShift Login plug-in polls the {product-title} API
server for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each
user with the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is
used to update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are
overwritten the next time the plug-in polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the
`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling
interval is five minutes.

The easiest way to create a new Jenkins service using OAuth authentication is to
use a template.
