= Using a NodePort to get traffic into the cluster

Use a `NodePort`-type `Service` resource to expose a service on a specific port
on all nodes in the cluster. The port is specified in the `Service` resource's
`.spec.ports[*].nodePort` field.

[NOTE]
====
Using `NodePort`s requires additional port resources.
====

A node port exposes the service on a static port on the node IP address.

`NodePort`s are in the `30000-32767` range by default, which means a `NodePort` is
unlikely to match a serviceâ€™s intended port. For example, `8080` may be exposed
as `31020`.

The administrator must ensure the external IPs are routed to the nodes.

`NodePort`s and external IPs are independent and both can be used concurrently.
