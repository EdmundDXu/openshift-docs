= Image Registry Operator configuration resources

In addition to the `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource,
additional configuration is provided to the Operator by separate ConfigMap and
Secret resources located within the `openshift-image-registry` namespace.

.Prerequisites
* The CAs must be PEM-encoded.

.Procedure

You can create a ConfigMap in the `openshift-config` namespace and use its name
in `AdditionalTrustedCA` in the `image.config.openshift.io` resource to provide
additional CAs that should be trusted when contacting external registries. The
key is the host name of a registry with the port for which this CA is to be
trusted. The `image-registry-private-configuration`(Secret) provides
credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default
credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

.Image registry CA example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  registry.example.com: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1>  If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`.
: should be replaced with `..`.

For S3 storage the ConfigMap is expected to contain two keys:

* REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ACCESSKEY
* REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECRETKEY

You can configure additional CAs with the following procedure.

. To configure an additional CA:
+
----
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=<external_registry_address>=ca.crt -n openshift-config
$ oc edit image.config.openshift.io cluster
spec:
  additionalTrustedCA:
    name: registry-config
----
+
. Check your image inside the `image-registry` pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh image-registry-xxxxx
sh-4.2
$ ls /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
<external_registry_address> image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc..5000 image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local..5000
