[id="installation-provide-credentials_{context}"]
= Configuring your computer for installation

Before you install your {product-title} cluster, add your Amazon Web Services (AWS)
credentials to you computer.

.Prerequisites

* Configure an AWS account to host your cluster and a user with sufficient
privileges to complete the installation process. You need details about the
account and user, including the access key ID and secret access key values for
the user.
* You must configure a computer that uses a Linux or macOS operating system.

.Procedure

. Download the AWS CLI and install it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)]
in the AWS documentation.

. Provide the configuration details for your account. Run the following command,
and provide details about your account at the prompts:
+
----
$ aws configure --profile=<profile_name> <1>

AWS Access Key ID [None]: accesskey <2>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: secretkey <2>
Default region name [None]: us-west-2 <3>
Default output format [None]:
----
<1> Enter a `<profile_name>` to store the credentials in.
<2> Enter the access key ID and secret access key values for the user that you
configured to run the installation program.
<3> Enter the name of the region that you plan to deploy your cluster to.

. Confirm that your profile is correctly configured:
+
----
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --profile=<profile_name> <1>

output:
{
    "Account": "123123123123",
    "UserId": "TH75ISMYR3F4RCHUS3R1D",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123123123123:user/refarchuser"
}
----
<1> Specify the same `<profile_name>`.
+
If the command output resembles the sample output, your profile is correctly
configured. If an error displays, configure your credentials again.

. Save the AWS profile:
+
----
$ export AWS_PROFILE=<profile_name> <1>
----
<1> Enter the `<profile_name>` that you specified.
