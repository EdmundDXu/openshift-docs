= Creating additional network interfaces

Additional interfaces for Pods are defined in CNI configurations that are stored
as Custom Resources (CRs). These CRs can be created, listed, edited, and deleted
using the `oc` tool.

The following procedure configures a `macvlan` interface on a Pod. This
configuration might not apply to all production environments, but you can use
the same procedure for other CNI plug-ins.

== Creating a CNI configuration for an additional interface as a CR

[NOTE]
====
If you want to attach an additional interface to a Pod, the CR that defines the
interface must be in the same project (namespace) as the Pod.
====

. Create a project to store CNI configurations as CRs and the Pods that will use
the CRs.
+
----
$ oc new-project multinetwork-example
----

. Create the CR that will define an additional network interface. Create a YAML
file called `macvlan-conf.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition <1>
metadata:
  name: macvlan-conf <2>
spec:
  config: '{ <3>
      "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "eth0",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "host-local",
        "subnet": "192.168.1.0/24",
        "rangeStart": "192.168.1.200",
        "rangeEnd": "192.168.1.216",
        "routes": [
          { "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" }
        ],
        "gateway": "192.168.1.1"
      }
    }'
----
+
<1> `kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition`. This is the name for the CR where this
configuration will be stored. It is a custom extension of Kubernetes that
defines how networks are attached to Pods.
<2> `name` maps to the annotation, which is used in the next step.
<3> `config`: The CNI configuration is packaged in the `config` field.
+
The configuration is specific to a plug-in, which enables `macvlan`. Note the
`type` line in the CNI configuration portion. Aside from the IPAM (IP address
management) parameters for networking, in this example the `master` field must
reference a network interface that resides on the node(s) hosting the Pod(s).

. Run the following command to create the CR:
+
----
$ oc create -f macvlan-conf.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
This example is based on a `macvlan` CNI plug-in. Note that in AWS environments,
macvlan traffic might be filtered and, therefore, might not reach the desired
destination.
====

== Managing the CRs for additional interfaces

You can manage the CRs for additional interfaces using the `oc` CLI.

Use the following command to list the CRs for additional interfaces:

----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io
----

Use the following command to delete CRs for additional interfaces:

----
$ oc delete network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io macvlan-conf
----

== Creating an annotated Pod that uses the CR

To create a Pod that uses the additional interface, use an annotation that
refers to the CR. Create a YAML file called `samplepod.yaml` for a Pod with the
following contents:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: samplepod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: samplepod
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 2000000000000"]
    image: centos/tools
----

<1> The `annotations` field contains `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks:
macvlan-conf`, which correlates to the `name` field in the CR defined earlier.

Run the following command to create the `samplepod` Pod:

----
$ oc create -f samplepod.yaml
----

To verify that an additional network interface has been created and attached to
the Pod, use the following command to list the IPv4 address information:

----
$ oc exec -it samplepod -- ip -4 addr
----

Three interfaces are listed in the output:

----
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1000 <1>
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0@if6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP  link-netnsid 0 <2>
    inet 10.244.1.4/24 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: net1@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN  link-netnsid 0 <3>
    inet 192.168.1.203/24 scope global net1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

<1> `lo`: A loopback interface.
<2> `eth0`: The interface that connects to the cluster-wide default network.
<3> `net1`: The new interface that you just created.

=== Attaching multiple interfaces to a Pod

To attach more than one additional interface to a Pod, specify multiple names,
in comma-delimited format, in the `annotations` field in the Pod definition.

The following `annotations` field in a Pod definition specifies different CRs
for the additional interfaces:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf, tertiary-conf, quaternary-conf
----

The following `annotations` field in a Pod definition specifies the same CR for
the additional interfaces:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf, macvlan-conf
----

== Viewing the interface configuration in a running Pod

After the Pod is running, you can review the configurations of the additional
interfaces created. To view the sample Pod from the earlier example, execute the
following command.

----
$ oc describe pod samplepod
----

The `metadata` section of the output contains a list of annotations, which are
displayed in JSON format:

[source,yaml]
----
Annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status:
    [{
        "name": "openshift-sdn",
        "ips": [
            "10.131.0.10"
        ],
        "default": true,
        "dns": {}
    },{
        "name": "macvlan-conf", <1>
        "interface": "net1", <2>
        "ips": [ <3>
            "192.168.1.200"
        ],
        "mac": "72:00:53:b4:48:c4", <4>
        "dns": {} <5>
    }]
----

<1> `name` refers to the custom resource name, `macvlan-conf`.
<2> `interface` refers to the name of the interface in the Pod.
<3> `ips` is a list of IP addresses as assigned to the Pod.
<4> `mac` is the MAC address of the interface.
<5> `dns` refers DNS for the interface.

The first annotation, `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf`, refers to the
CR created in the example. This annotation was specified in the Pod definition.

The second annotation is `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status`. There are two
interfaces listed under `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status`.

* The first interface describes the interface for the default network,
`openshift-sdn`. This interface is created as `eth0`. It is used for
communications within the cluster.

* The second interface is the additional interface that you created, `net1`. The
output above lists some key values that were configured when the interface was
created, for example, the IP addresses that were assigned to the Pod.
