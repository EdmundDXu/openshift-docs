= Contents of the Alerting UI

This section shows and explains the contents of the Alerting UI, a Web interface to the Alertmanager.

The main two pages of the Alerting UI are the *Alerts* and the *Silences* pages.

The *Alerts* page is located in *Monitoring* -> *Alerts* of the {product-title} web console.
