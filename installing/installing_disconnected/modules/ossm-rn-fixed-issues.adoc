Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear  (If you have the foo option enabled and did x)? What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause - Why did this happen?
Fix - What did we change to fix the problem?

The following issues been resolved in the current release:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-4[MAISTRA-4] - The uninstall does not remove all the files, and as a result, when you re-install the istio-operator installation fails because `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "installations.istio.openshift.com"` already exists.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-5[MAISTRA-5] - `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod tries to start but with errors.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-13[MAISTRA-13] - Installer should determine release version from installed components.  At present, the installer queries the yaml file, however if the yaml has been modified, the installer is not able to remove an older version.

* https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/pull/19/[MAISTRA-21] -  The default in the installer of 512Mi was too low for tracing.  Increased default Elasticsearch memory from 512 MB to 1 GB.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-61[MAISTRA-61] After all applicable resources are deployed to OpenShift, Istio sidecars may lose information about their routes and can no longer communicate with services until the next update is received.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-79[MAISTRA-79] - Running the `istiooc cluster up` command results in the istio-operator namespace deploying a pod responsible for continually ensuring the Elasticsearch sysctl requirements are met. This loop runs constantly causing a significant load on the system running the cluster.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-110[MAISTRA-110] In large clusters, citadel can take a significant amount of time to create secrets. This may cause the installation to fail.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-157[MAISTRA-157] The conditional rate limiting feature does not restrict access as expected.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-196[MAISTRA-196] If you edit the installation to modify a parameter, for example to enable authentication, the new installation will fail due to the existence of the new 1.1 CRD configmaps.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-420[MAISTRA-420] [Multi-tenant implementation] The Jaeger agent pods are unscheduled as a result of port collision in multi-tenancy deployment on OpenShift 4.1.rc.5.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-245[MAISTRA-245] The sidecar injector pod fails to start if you are running the upstream community version.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-462[MAISTRA-462] [Multi-tenant implementation] After adding a namespace member to a second control plane, Kiali does not display the namespace member in the namespace list because the namespace for the second control plane is missing the `maistra.io/member-of` and `istio.openshift.io/member-of` labels. This is a result of the installation of the second control plane failing due to https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-464[MAISTRA-464](the operator can't create the `istio-ingressgateway` service in the second control plane, because the NodePort already being used by the first control plane). The workaround is to manually change the node ports of the `istio-ingressgateway` service in the first control plane's namespace (using `oc edit svc`). The operator will then be able to finish deploying the second control plane.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-466[MAISTRA-466] [Multi-tenant implementation] When you install more than one control plane, the operator overwrites the Kiali oauthclient yaml on any existing Kiali installations so that only the most recent installation functions. The Kiali oauthclient (`oc get oauthclients kiali`) contains a list of the authorized URLs that OpenShift OAuth will redirect to. If your URL is not part of this list, then the oauth login will fail and return the following message:
+
----
`{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
+

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-469[MAISTRA-469] If you delete a project before deleting the ServiceMeshControlPlane, the cleanup process does not execute for resources in the deleted project. Service accounts added to the SecurityContextConstraints are not removed and the Kiali OAuthClient resource is not updated properly.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-470[MAISTRA-470] If you include the control plane namespace in the member roll, the reconciliation process produces an error that spams the logs and prevents the status of the configuredMembers list from updating even for members that were successfully configured.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1284[KIALI-1284] In Istio, a Workload can be any pod or group of pods, regardless where they originate from. They may come from Kubernetes Deployments, Replica Sets or even as a single "orphan" pod. In Kiali the current assumption is that a Workload comes from a Deployment. This should represent the vast majority of the cases.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1570[KIALI-1570]
When a graph is loading in the Kiali console, a message that the graph is empty is displayed instead of a message that the graph is loading.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1572[KIALI-1572]
If you see this ERROR message when you view the Kiali logs, you can ignore it:
+
----
Failed to determine console version from file [/opt/kiali/console/version.txt]. error=open /opt/kiali/console/version.txt: no such file or directory Kiali: Console version: unknown
----
+
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1609[KIALI-1609]
When dealing with very small values (for example, less than 0.0.1 rps) you might encounter some inconsistencies in the graph. We are working on making changes to have this function better when dealing with very small values.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2261[KIALI-2261] In the Kiali graph, unused links (that is, edges with no traffic) are being labeled as having 100% of the request traffic, even though there is currently no request traffic. See also https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2296[KIALI-2296].

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2403[KIALI-2403] The Istio version is no longer listed on the Kiali About page after moving to Istio 1.1.0-snapshot.6, because the latest Istio Pilot now listens on a different port. Istio Pilot listens on port 8080, and you can visit Pilot to determine the Istio version (http://istio-pilot:8080/version).

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2430[KIALI-2430] When you click on a TCP edge, and then click on an HTTP edge the graph crashes in Kiali.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2671[KIALI-2671] If you *do not* specify a dashboard user/password in the control plane custom resource  the operator will use Oauth for the installation. The OpenShift strategy for using Oauth does not work in {ProductName} {ProductVersion} Technology Preview 10. As a workaround, ensure that you provide a user and password in the custom resource.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2942[KIALI-2942] When using OpenShift OAuth, when you click the logout link, you are still logged into the Kiali console. When you go to the login URL it will check your cookies and then automatically log you back in.  The workaround is to delete the Kiali cookie.
