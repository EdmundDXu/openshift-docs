= Specifying the number of pods that must be up with pod disruption budgets

You can use a `PodDisruptionBudget` object to specify the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time.

.Procedure

To configure a pod disruption budget:

. Create a YAML file with the an object definition similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 <1>
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  selector:  <2>
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  minAvailable: 2  <3>
----
<1> `PodDisruptionBudget` is part of the `policy/v1beta1` API group.
<2> A label query over a set of resources. The result of `matchLabels` and
 `matchExpressions` are logically conjoined.
<3> The minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously. This can
be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage (for example, `20%`).

. Run the following command to add the object to project:
+
----
$ oc create -f </path/to/file> -n <project_name>
----
