=  Managing quotas and limit ranges

As an administrator, you are able to view, create, and modify quotas limit
ranges on other projects. This allows you to better constrain how compute
resources and objects are consumed by users across the cluster.

Defaults can be set for quotas and limit ranges for new projects at creation. To
request such a change, open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
