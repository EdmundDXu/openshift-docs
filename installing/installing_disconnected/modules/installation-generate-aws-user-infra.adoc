= Creating the installation files for AWS

To install {product-title} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using user-provisioned
infrastructure, you must generate the files that the installation
program needs to deploy your cluster and modify them so that the cluster creates
only the machines that it will use. You generate and customize the
`install_config.yaml` file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must complete your cluster
installation and keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state
to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Obtain the `install-config.yaml` file.
.. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Specify an empty directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
... Select AWS as the platform to target.
... If you do not have an AWS profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
... Paste the pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers] page.

. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to set the number of compute, or worker,
replicas to `0`, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
----

. Optional: Back up the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the next step. If you want to
reuse the file, back it up now.
====

. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files for the control plane machines. By
removing these files, you prevent the cluster from automatically generating
control plane machines.
.. Generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir=<installation_directory> <1>

WARNING There are no compute nodes specified. The cluster will not fully initialize without compute nodes.
INFO Consuming "Install Config" from target directory
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
Because you create your own compute machines later in the installation process,
you can safely ignore this warning.
.. Remove the files that define the control plane machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml
----

ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-aws-user-infra"]
. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*
----
+
Because you create and manage the worker machines yourself, you do not need
to initialize these machines.
endif::[]

. Obtain the Ignition config files:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
The following files are generated in the directory:
+
----
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
