= Deploying the control plane

With the introduction of {product-title} 4.1, the network capabilities of the host are now based on nftables rather than iptables. This change impacts the initialization of the {ProductName} application components. {ProductShortName} needs to know what host operating system OpenShift is running on to correctly initialize {ProductShortName} networking components.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to follow this procedure if you are using {product-title} 4.1.
====

If the OpenShift installation is deployed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 host, then the custom resource must explicitly request the RHEL 7 `proxy-init` container image by including the following:

Use the custom resource definition file you created to deploy the {ProductShortName} control plane.


.Procedure

. Create a custom resource definition file named `istio-installation.yaml`.

. Run this command to deploy the control plane:
+
----
$ oc create -n istio-system -f istio-installation.yaml
----

. Run this command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n istio-system -w
