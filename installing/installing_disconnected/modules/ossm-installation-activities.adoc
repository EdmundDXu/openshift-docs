= {ProductName} installation activities

The {ProductName} installation process creates two different projects (namespaces):

* istio-operator project (1 pod)
* istio-system project (17 pods)
* kiali-operator project (1 pod)
* observability project (1 pod)

You first create a Kubernetes _Operator_. This Operator defines and monitors a _custom resource_ that manages the deployment, updating, and deletion of the {ProductShortName} components.

Depending on how you define the custom resource file, you can install one or more of the following components when you install the {ProductShortName}:

* *Istio* - based on the  open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio] project, lets you connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that make up your applications.
* *Jaeger* - based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] project, lets you perform tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.
* *Kiali* - based on the open source link:https://www.kiali.io/[Kiali] project, Kiali provides observability for your service mesh. Using Kiali lets you view configurations, monitor traffic, and view and analyze traces in a single console.
