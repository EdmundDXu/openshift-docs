*Setting the maximum number of connections*

One of the most important tunable parameters for HAProxy scalability is the
`maxconn` parameter, which sets the maximum per-process number of concurrent
connections to a given number. Adjust this parameter by editing the
`ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` environment variable in the {product-title} HAProxy
router's deployment configuration file.

[NOTE]
====
A connection includes the front end and internal back end. This counts as two
connections. Be sure to set `ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` to double than the number
of connections you intend to create.

*CPU and interrupt affinity*

In {product-title}, the HAProxy router runs as a single process. The
{product-title} HAProxy router typically performs better on a system with fewer
but high frequency cores, rather than on an symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
system with a high number of lower frequency cores.

Pinning the HAProxy process to one CPU core and the network interrupts to
another CPU core tends to increase network performance. Having processes and
interrupts on the same non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node helps avoid memory
accesses by ensuring a shared L3 cache. However, this level of control is
generally not possible on a public cloud environment.

CPU pinning is performed either by `taskset` or by using HAProxy's `cpu-map`
parameter. This directive takes two arguments: the process ID and the CPU core
ID. For example, to pin HAProxy process `1` onto CPU core `0`, add the following
line to the global section of HAProxy's configuration file:

----
    cpu-map 1 0
----

*Increasing the number of threads*

The HAProxy router comes with support for multithreading in {product-title}. On
a multiple CPU core system, increasing the number of threads can help the
performance, especially when terminating SSL on the router.

*Impacts of buffer increases*

The {product-title} HAProxy router request buffer configuration limits the size
of headers in incoming requests and responses from applications. The HAProxy
parameter `tune.bufsize` can be increased to allow processing of larger headers
and to allow applications with very large cookies to work, such as those
accepted by load balancers provided by many public cloud providers. However,
this affects the total memory use, especially when large numbers of connections
are open. With very large numbers of open connections, the memory usage will be
nearly proportionate to the increase of this tunable parameter.

*Optimizations for HAProxy reloads*

Long-lasting connections, such as WebSocket connections, combined with
long client/server HAProxy timeouts and short HAProxy
reload intervals, can cause instantiation of many HAProxy processes.
These processes must handle old connections, which were started
before the HAProxy configuration reload. A large number of these processes is
undesirable, as it will exert unnecessary load on the system and can
lead to issues, such as out of memory conditions.

Router environment variables affecting this
behavior are `ROUTER_DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT`, `ROUTER_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`,
`ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT`, and `RELOAD_INTERVAL` in particular.
