= Deleting a virtual machine and PVCs using the CLI

When you delete a virtual machine, the PVC it uses is unbound.

If you do not plan to bind this PVC to a different VM, it is best practice to delete it, in order to
maintain a clean environment and avoid possible confusion.

.Procedure

Run these commands to delete the virtual machine and the PVC.

NOTE: You can delete objects only in the project you are currently working in,
unless you specify the `-n <project_name>` option, for project name.

. Run the following command to delete the virtual machine:
+
----
$ oc delete vm <fedora-vm>
----
+
. Run the following command to delete the PVC associated with the virtual machine.
+
----
$ oc delete pvc <fedora-vm-pvc>
----
