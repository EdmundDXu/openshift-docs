| Number of pods per namespace footnoteref:[objectpernamespace,There are
a number of control loops in the system that must iterate over all objects
in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large
number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops
expensive and slow down processing given state changes. The limit assumes that 
the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk to satisfy the application requirements.]

In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by
the system compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions.

In {product-title} 4.1, the tested node limit has been lowered until scale tests can be run at
a higher node count.
