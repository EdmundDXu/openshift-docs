= Scaling your Elasticsearch cluster

You can scale the number of data nodes in Elasticsearch.

For example, if you want to increase redundancy, and use the `FullRedundancy` or `MultipleRedundancy` policy, you can scale up the cluster to increase the number of shard replicas in your cluster.  

[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of Elasticsearch master nodes is three. If you specify a `nodeCount` greater than `3`, {product-title} creates three Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only nodes, using client and data roles. Master nodes perform cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, shard allocation, and tracking nodes. Data nodes hold the shards and perform data-related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations. Data-related operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to monitor these resources and to add more Data nodes if the current nodes are overloaded.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. To scale up the cluster, edit the Elasticsearch Custom Resource (CR) to add a number of nodes of a specific type:
+
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
...

  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 5 <1>
      storage:
        storageClassName: gp2
        size: 200G
      redundancyPolicy: "SingleRedundancy"
----
<1> Specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes. This example adds two nodes to the default 3. The new nodes will be Data-only nodes.

////
. To scale down, edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project to reduce the number of nodes of a specific type:
+
----
oc edit clusterlogging instance
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
...
nodes:
  - nodeCount: 2 <1>
    nodeSpec:
      resources: {}
----
<1> Specify the number of nodes you want in your cluster.
