= Using manual sidecar injection

Manual injection of the sidecar is supported using the upstream Istio community `istioctl` command.

[NOTE]

When you use manual sidecar injection, ensure you have access to a running cluster so the correct configuration can be obtained from the istio-sidecar-injector configmap within the istio-system namespace.
