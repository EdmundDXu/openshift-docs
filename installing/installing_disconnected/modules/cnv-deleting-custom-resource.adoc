= Deleting the KubeVirt HyperConverged custom resource

To uninstall {ProductName}, you must delete the custom resource that you created
during deployment.

.Prerequisites

* An active *KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator Deployment* custom resource

.Procedure

. From the {product-title} web console, select `kubevirt-hyperconverged` from
the *Projects* list.

. Navigate to the *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators* page.

. Click *KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator*.

. Click the *KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator Deployment* tab.

. Click the Options menu {kebab} in the row containing the *kubevirt-hyperconverged*
custom resource. In the expanded menu, click *Delete HyperConverged*.

. Click *Delete* in the confirmation window.

. Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page to verify that only the Operator
Pods are running.

. Open a terminal window and clean up the remaining KubeVirt resources by running
the following command:
+
----
$ oc delete apiservices v1alpha3.subresources.kubevirt.io -n kubevirt-hyperconverged
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Because some KubeVirt resources are currently improperly retained, you must
manually remove them. These resources will be removed automatically after
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712429[*BZ1712429*]) is
resolved.
