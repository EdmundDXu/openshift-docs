= Differences between multi-tenant and cluster-wide installations

The main difference between a multi-tenant installation and a cluster-wide installation is the scope of privileges used by the control plane deployments, for example, Galley and Pilot. The components no longer use cluster-scoped Role Based Access Control (RBAC) `ClusterRoleBinding`, but rely on namespace-scoped RBAC `RoleBinding`.

Every namespace in the `members` list will have a `RoleBinding` for each service account associated with a control plane deployment and each control plane deployment will only watch those member namespaces. Each member namespace has a `maistra.io/member-of` label added to it, where the `member-of` value is the namespace containing the control plane installation.
