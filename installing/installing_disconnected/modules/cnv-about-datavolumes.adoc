= About DataVolumes

`DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized
Data Importer (CDI) project. DataVolumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload
operations that are associated with an underlying PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
DataVolumes are integrated with KubeVirt, and they prevent a virtual machine
from being started before the PVC has been prepared.
