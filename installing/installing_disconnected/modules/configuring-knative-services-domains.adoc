= Configuring domains for Knative services

The Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator will attempt to find the public domain that is used by the cluster and use that same domain for Knative Services. Having a domain configured makes it possible to reach services in your cluster via HTTP over the internet directly, for example, using the `curl` command.

Alternatively, you can configure a different domain for Knative services or even configure a different domain for different Knative services based on labels. Once you have completed this configuration, you can create a template for the domain configuration.

.Procedure
. To change the configuration for Knative services, you must edit the `config-domain` ConfigMap in the `knative-serving` namespace using `oc edit`.

   # oc edit cm config-domain -n knative-serving

. Copy the sample ConfigMap and modify the relevant fields.
