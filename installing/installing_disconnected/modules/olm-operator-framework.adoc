= Operator Framework

The Operator Framework is a family of tools and capabilities to deliver on the
customer experience described above. It is not just about writing code; testing,
delivering, and updating Operators is just as important. The Operator Framework
components consist of open source tools to tackle these problems:

Operator SDK::
Assists Operator authors in bootstrapping, building, testing, and packaging
their own Operator based on their expertise without requiring knowledge of
Kubernetes API complexities.

Operator Lifecycle Manager::
Controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of
Operators in a cluster. Deployed by default in {product-title}
{product-version}.

Operator Metering::
Collects operational metrics about Operators on the cluster for Day 2 management
and aggregating usage metrics.

OperatorHub::
Web console for discovering and installing Operators on your cluster. Deployed
by default in {product-title} {product-version}.

These tools are designed to be composable, so you can use any that are useful to
you.
