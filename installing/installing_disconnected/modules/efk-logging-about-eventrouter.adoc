= About Event Router

The Event Router is a pod that forwards {product-title} events to cluster logging.
You must manually deploy Event Router.

The Event Router collects events and converts them into JSON format, which takes 
those events and pushes them to `STDOUT`. Fluentd indexes the events to the 
`.operations` index.
