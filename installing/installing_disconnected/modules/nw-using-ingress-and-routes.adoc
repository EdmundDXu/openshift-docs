= Using Ingress Controllers and routes

The Ingress Operator manages Ingress Controllers and wildcard DNS.

Using an Ingress Controller is the most common way to allow external access to
an {product-title} cluster.

An Ingress Controller is configured to accept external requests and proxy them
based on the configured routes. This is limited to HTTP, HTTPS using SNI, and
TLS using SNI, which is sufficient for web applications and services that work
over TLS with SNI.

Work with your administrator to configure an Ingress Controller
to accept external requests and proxy them based on the
configured routes.

The administrator can create a wildcard DNS entry and then set up an Ingress
Controller. Then, you can work with the edge Ingress Controller without
having to contact the administrators.

When a set of routes is created in various projects, the overall set of routes
is available to the set of Ingress Controllers. Each Ingress Controller admits
routes from the set of routes. By default, all Ingress Controllers
admit all routes.

Ingress Controllers that have permission to view all of the labels in all
projects can select routes to admit based on the labels. This is called Ingress
Controller sharding. This is useful when balancing incoming traffic load among a
set of Ingress Controllers and when isolating traffic to a specific Ingress
Controller. For example, company A goes to one Ingress Controller and company B
to another.

The Ingress Controller:

* Has two replicas by default, which means it should be running on two worker nodes.
* Can be scaled up to have more replicas on more nodes.
