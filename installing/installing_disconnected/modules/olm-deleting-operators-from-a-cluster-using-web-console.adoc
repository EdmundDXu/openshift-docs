= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

To delete an installed Operator from the selected namespace through the web
console, follow these steps:

.Procedure

. Select the Operator to delete. There are two paths to do this:

** From the *Catalog* → *OperatorHub* page:
+
--
. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword box* (in this case,
`jaeger`) to find the Operator you want and click on it.

. Click *Uninstall*.
--

** From the  *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page:
+
--
. Select the namespace where the Operator is installed from the *Project* list.
For cluster-wide Operators, the default is `openshift-operators`.

. From the *Operator Subscriptions* tab, find the Operator you want to delete (in
this example, `jaeger`) and click the Options menu {kebab} at the end of its
entry.

. Click *Remove Subscription*.
--

. When prompted by the *Remove Subscription* window, optionally select the
*Also completely remove the jaeger Operator from the selected namespace*
check box if you want all components related to the installation to be removed.
This removes the CSV, which in turn removes the Pods, Deployments, CRDs, and CRs
associated with the Operator.

. Select *Remove*. This Operator will stop running and no longer receive updates.

[NOTE]
====
Although the Operator is no longer installed or receiving updates, that Operator
will still appear on the Operator Catalogs list, ready to re-subscribe. To
remove the Operator from that listing, you can delete the Operator's entry in
the CatalogSourceConfig from the command line (as shown in last step of
"Deleting operators from a cluster using the CLI").
