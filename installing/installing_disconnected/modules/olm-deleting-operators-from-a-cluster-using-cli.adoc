= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the CLI

Instead of using the {product-title} web console, you can delete an Operator
from your cluster by using the CLI. You do this by deleting the Subscription and
ClusterServiceVersion from the `targetNamespace`, then editing the
CatalogSourceConfig to remove the Operator's package name.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admin-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]
- Install the `oc` command on your local system.

.Procedure

In this example, there are two operators (Jaeger and Descheduler) installed in the
`openshift-operators` namespace. The goal is to remove Jaeger without removing Descheduler.

. Delete the Operator's subscription (for example, `jaeger`):
+
----
$ oc delete subscription jaeger -n openshift-operators
subscription.operators.coreos.com "jaeger" deleted
----

. Check the current version of the subscribed Operator (for example, `jaeger`):
+
----
$ oc get subscription jaeger -n openshift-operators -o yaml | grep currentCSV
  currentCSV: jaeger-operator.v1.8.2
----

. Delete the CSV for the Operator (`jaeger`) in the `targetNamespace`
(`openshift-operators`):
+
----
$ oc delete clusterserviceversion jaeger-operator.v1.8.2 -n openshift-operators
clusterserviceversion.operators.coreos.com "jaeger-operator.v1.8.2" deleted
----

. Display the contents of the `CatalogSourceConfig` resource and review the list
of packages in the `spec` section:
+
----
$ oc get catalogsourceconfig -n openshift-marketplace \
    installed-community-openshift-operators -o yaml
----
+
For example, the spec section might appear as follows:
+
.Example of CatalogSourceConfig
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  csDisplayName: Community Operators
  csPublisher: Community
  packages: jaeger,descheduler
  targetNamespace: openshift-operators
----

. Remove the Operator from the CatalogSourceConfig in one of two ways:

** If you have multiple Operators, edit the CatalogSourceConfig resource and
remove the Operator's package:
+
----
$ oc edit catalogsourceconfig -n openshift-marketplace \
    installed-community-openshift-operators
----
+
Remove the package from the `packages` line, as shown:
+
.Example of modified packages in CatalogSourceConfig
[source,yaml]
----
  packages: descheduler
----
+
Save the change and the `marketplace-operator` will reconcile the
CatalogSourceConfig.

** If there is only one Operator in the CatalogSourceConfig, you can remove it
by deleting the entire CatalogSourceConfig as follows:
+
----
$ oc delete catalogsourceconfig -n openshift-marketplace \
    installed-community-openshift-operators
----
