=  Managing {product-title} administrators

Administrator roles are managed using a `dedicated-admins` group on the cluster.
Existing members of this group can edit membership. To view a list of current
dedicated administrators by user name, you can use the following command:

----
$ oc describe group dedicated-admins
----

To add a new member to the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oc adm groups add-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

To remove an existing user from the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oc adm groups remove-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

If this group is currently empty or if you need assistance editing group
membership, open a support case on the
