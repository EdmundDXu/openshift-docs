= Configuring namespaces in multi-tenant installations

A multi-tenant control plane installation only affects namespaces configured as part of the {ProductShortName}. You must specify the namespaces associated with the {ProductShortName} in a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource located in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and name it `default`.

[WARNING]
====
If Container Network Interface (CNI) is enabled, manual sidecar injection will work, but pods will not be able to communicate with the control plane unless they are a part of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
====

[NOTE]
====
The member namespaces are only updated if the {ProductShortName} control plane installation succeeds.
====

* You can add any number of namespaces, but a namespace can only belong to *one* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resources are reconciled in response to the following events:

** The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created, updated, or deleted
** The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource in the namespace containing the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created or updated
** A namespace listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created or deleted

The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is deleted when its corresponding `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deleted.

Here is an example that joins the bookinfo namespace into the {ProductShortName}:

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {ProductShortName} Operator.
* Location of the namespace where the custom resource installed the control plane.

.Procedure

. Create a custom resource file named `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource.

. Name the resource `default`.

. Add the namespaces to the member list in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`. The `bookinfo` namespace is joined to the {ProductShortName} in this example.
